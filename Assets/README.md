-In this project, I built a portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS basics. 
-The most challenging part was to apply the Flexbox principles and making sure the boxes would adjust and follow the Media Query.
-I used a lot of bits and pieces of code from other sources to contruct my portfolio.
-Each image directs you to a website as a place holder.
-The Code-refactoring link is directed to my deployed GitHub Page.
-The Bakery Collab link is directed to my collaboration page that I am working with a classmate.
